* Oops! Seems like my automation for generating the changelog broke. 
* Well, tbh I'm not sure how much has been changed since the last release.
* To give you a TL;DR, the whole kernel was rebuilt on top of subhajeetmuhuri's tree. So the bugs that were present on the previous builds of the kernel have been vanquished.
* Some of the functionality of the previous builds have also been removed.
* However, thanks to this rebuild, we were able to arrive at a very stable build of Stratosphere. 
* Shoutout to the community on Telegram
* Until next time.
